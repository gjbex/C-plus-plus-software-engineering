C++ is widely used in many contexts.
This training focusses on software engineering aspects of C++ such
as building software, linting, testing libraries and applications,
and so on.
Also, best practices are discussed such as design patterns.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * assess code quality;
  * build software using CMake;
  * perform static code analysis and interprete the results;
  * write unit tests using Catch2;
  * write functional tests using CTest;
  * use C++ package managagers such as Conan or vcpkg;
  * use some design patterns that are useful in scientific programming;
  * program in an efficient functional style using STL algorithms and rangs..

## Training materials

Slides and source code are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/C-plus-plus-software-engineering),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use the C++ programming
language for production applications.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in C++,
This is *not* a training that teaches you how to program in C++.
You also need to be familiar with the Bash command line.
