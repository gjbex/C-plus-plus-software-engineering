# Expected

Illustrates how to use `std::expected` for error handling, showcasing the
monadic interface (slightly over the top).

## What is it?

1. `fac.cpp`: C++ application that reads an argument from the command line,
   validates the value, computes the factorial and displays the output or
   the error message.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
