# Sort

Implementation of two sorting algorithms, a very naive one and quicksort.

## What is it?

1. `sort.h`: C++ template implementation of naive and quicksort, works for any
   random-access container with elements for which the `<`-operator is supported.
1. `tdd_test.cpp`: Catch2 unit testing for the sorting algorithms.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the tests.
1. `build.sh`: script to build and run the tests.
