# Math Kernal Library (MKL)

BLAS and Lapack are two libraries for matrix computations and linear algebra
that are widely used in scientific computing.  Here you'll find some
illustrations of their use.


## What is it?

1. `sgemm.cpp`: simple matrix-matrix multiplication using specific MKL APIs.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
