# fmt

Very simple application that depends on the `fmt` library.

## What is it?

1. `main.cpp`: very simple application that uses the `fmt` library
   to write an `std::vector` to standard output.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file that builds the applications, it
   downloads CPM if necessary, and downloads and install the
   dependencies defined in it.
