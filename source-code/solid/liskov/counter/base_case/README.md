# Base case

Simple implementation of the absolute and relative counters as independent
classes with quite some code duplication.


## What is it?

1. `absolute_counter.h`: definition of the absolute counter class.
1. `absolute_counter.cpp`: implementation of the absolute counter class.
1. `relative_counter.h`: definition of the relative counter class.
1. `relative_counter.cpp`: implementation of the relative counter class.
1. `utils.h`: utility functions to parse command line arguments.
1. `utils.cpp`: implementation of the utility functions.
1. `counter_main.cpp`: main function that uses the absolute and relative
   counters.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the application.
